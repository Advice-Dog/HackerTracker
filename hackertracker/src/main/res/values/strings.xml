        Workshops are free, first come, first served, and seats will fill up fast!\n\n
        To register for a workshop, you will need to go to the Bally\'s side in front of the cafe arcade between Thursday 07:00 to 15:00. We will have goons to pre-register you for the workshop(s) of your choosing.\n\n
        If the workshop that you want has filled up before you got there, don\'t worry! Just like last year, if you come to the workshop area early the day of, you can wait in the standby line. If a seat opens up, it will be made available to the first person waiting to claim it.\n\n
        Please Note: You will be issued a workshop \"pass\". It will be required for class admission. If you lose it we can\'t help you, your seat will be made available for those in standby.

        <big>Airport Shuttle Service to DEF CON 23!</big>\n\nIt\'s a known fact: Vegas cab drivers can be … indirect. Even worse, it\'s a real challenge to keep a cab smelling daisy-fresh in 110 degree heat. So how does one get from the airport to Paris and Bally\'s without taking an unnecessary tour of Henderson and baking like a potato?\n\nThere is a way.\n\nWe\'ve partnered with LASxpress to shuttle DEF CON attendees from McCarran to their hotels, Paris and Bally\'s and otherwise. It costs 11 bucks (18 non-stop), and has the benefits of meet and greet service and immediate boarding.\n\nOf course, there is something of a vision-quest feeling to waiting around in the desert, sweating in a small space as you travel aimlessly throughout the universe. So, you can still do that, too.\n\nIf you\'d rather try the shuttle route, just click here to register: http://lasrescenter.hudsonltd.net/res?USERIDENTRY=DEFCON2014&amp;LOGON=GO

    <array name="faq_questions">
        <item>When and where is DEF CON 24?</item>
        <item>DEF CON is generally in the last week of July or first week of August in Las Vegas. DEF CON 24 will be held August 4&#8211;7, 2016 at Paris and Bally\'s in Las Vegas. Many people arrive a day early, and many stay a day later. Again this year we will have some things running on Thursday.</item>
        <item>Is DEF CON 24 canceled? </item>
        <item>No.</item>
        <item>How much is admission?</item>
        <item>$240.00 USD, Cash for all four days. Everyone pays the same: The government, the media, the \'well known hackers\', the unknown script kiddies. The only discount is for Goons and speakers, who get to work without paying for the privilege. We only accept cash - no checks, no money orders, no travelers checks. We don\'t want to be a target of any State or Federal fishing expeditions.  </item>
        <item>Can I pre&#8211;register for DEF CON? </item>
        <item>No.    </item>
        <item>How many people will be there?</item>
        <item>Last year we had more than 15,000 people at DEF CON! The last few years, attendence has been in the 12&#8211;14k range.</item>
        <item>How much do rooms at Paris and Bally\'s cost, and how do I reserve a room?</item>
        <item>The DEF CON rate is available at the following hotels: Paris, Bally\'s, Flamingo and Quad. Check out the DEF CON 24 Venue page for all the details! https://defcon.org/html/defcon-24/dc-24-venue.html </item>
        <item>I can\'t afford that.</item>
        <item>Try the Ride and Room sharing threads on the Forums - https://forum.defcon.org/forumdisplay.php?f=26. You may also want to visit your Local DEF CON Groups meeting and see who you might want to bunk up with. It\'s important to mention you should use good judgment when sharing a room and consider who is sleeping next to you and who has access to your belongings. That said, there are a lot of great people looking to save a buck or pinch a penny, good luck. </item>
        <item>I need a letter of invite for my visa application, how do I get that?</item>
        <item>In most cases, DEF CON can send a signed letter of invite, usually within a few short business days once we have all the info. If you also require verification of housing, we can put you in touch with someone to help you get your hotel stay organized, let us know if you need that.\n\n

        <item>How much is internet access in the rooms of Paris and Bally\'s?</item>
        <item>We\'ll let you know soon. Internet access is available for free in the convention area.</item>
        <item>Is there a free network at DEF CON? </item>
        <item>Why yes, DEF CON 24 is FULLY network&#8211;enabled. Now that we\'ve perfected the art of a stable hacker con network, we\'re ascending to a higher level &#8211; we\'re providing you a network that you feel SAFE in using! Since DEF CON 18 we\'re WPA2 encrypted over&#8211;the&#8211;air, with a direct trunk out to the Internet. No peer&#8211;to&#8211;peer, no sniffing, just straight to the net (and internal servers).

Share &amp;enjoy!  </item>
        <item>Will Paris and Bally\'s allow free parking? </item>
        <item>Yes. You will be able to park for free regardless if you have a room at Paris and Bally\'s.       </item>
        <item>What about the smoking policy?</item>
        <item>Due to the Clean Air Act in Las Vegas, the Vendor Area, Speaking rooms, and Hallways will be completely non&#8211;smoking in order to comply with the law. The Hotel will have designated smoking areas clearly posted. There is a discussion about it on the DEF CON Forums here: https://forum.defcon.org/showthread.php?t=8200     Any news and info will likely be posted there.</item>
        <item>What is the age limit?</item>
        <item>People have brought children to DEF CON &#8211; it is not recommended to do this unless you are going to constantly supervise them. It is generally an ‘adult’ atmosphere (language, booze, et cetera). If you\'ve never been to DEF CON, you may want to refrain from bringing your children (unless they are demanding that you bring them). While there are no age limits, we have consistently cooperated with parents and/or private investigators who are looking for children that ‘ran away from home’ to go to DEF CON. You must be 18 years of age or older to reserve a hotel room and to check&#8211;in. A valid ID is required upon check&#8211;in. DEF CON 24 will have enforcement of the 21 or older rule in certain "private" parties with possible bouncers at the doors checking IDs. This is generally the rule in all areas where alcohol is being served. However, DEF CON does not take responsibility for anything potentially indecent or offensive your minor may witness or participate in. The underage attendee is the responsibility of his or her guardian or themselves. The presentations are open to all ages. Observation of contests as they take place on the contest floor is open to all ages. Competition in some contests may have age restrictions due to laws. There is plenty fun to be had without booze and gambling! There is a discussion regarding fun for those under 21 on the forums. https://forum.defcon.org/showthread.php?t=8232 </item>
        <item>I want to speak, how do I give a talk?</item>
        <item>GREAT! We are looking for and give preference to: unique research, new tool releases, Ø&#8211;day attacks (with responsible disclosure), highly technical material, social commentaries, and ground breaking material of any kind. Want to screen a new hacking documentary or release research? Consider DEF CON. To submit a speech, read the Announcement and complete the DEF CON 23 Call for Papers Form: https://www.defcon.org/html/defcon-23/dc-23-cfp-form.html CFP forms and questions should get mailed to: talks/at/defcon.org</item>
        <item>When does the CFP Close? Can I get an Extension?</item>
        <item>DEF CON 24 Call For Papers will close on May 2, 2016.</item>
        <item>How can I help or participate?</item>
        <item>DEF CON is not a spectator sport! Before the con, during, and after there are chances for you to get involved. Below is a list of this years contests and events. This list may not be complete so check the forums to see what people are up to. Go to the forums for more info on Contests and Events: https://forum.defcon.org/forumdisplay.php?f=767 </item>
        <item>How do I become a Vendor?</item>
        <item>You may apply for vendorhood at http://defconvendors.com/. If you want a space in our vendor area, you need to apply. Because of limited space and our attempt to have a diversity of vendors, you may not be able to get a booth. It is wise to think of staffing issues - if you are one person do you want to spend your entire time behind a vendors booth?</item>
        <item>I\'m press, how do I sign up, why can\'t I get in for free (I\'m just doing my job)? </item>
        <item>Please check out the DEF CON 24 Press Registration page (https://www.defcon.org/html/defcon-24/dc-24-press.html) if you wish press credentials. Lots of people come to DEF CON and are doing their job; security professionals, federal agents, and the press. It wouldn\'t be fair to DEF CON attendees if we exempted one group from paying. If you are a major network and plan on doing a two minute piece showing all the people with blue hair, you probably shouldn\'t bother applying for a press pass - you won\'t get one. If you are a security writer or from a real publication please submit, and someone will respond with an answer.</item>
        <item>What should I bring to DEF CON? </item>
        <item>It depends on what you\'re going to do at DEF CON. This is discussed in quite some depth on the unofficial DC FAQ (http://defcon.stotan.org/faq/) , as well as a thread in the DC Forums (https://forum.defcon.org/showthread.php?t=5483). You may want to bring fancy (or outrageously silly) clothes for the Black and White Balls, annual Friday and Saturday night events where everyone shows off nifty attire. SWAG is Always recommended, people LOVE to trade! You never know when or where a t&#8211;shirt with your .org will come in handy. Government SWAG is a hot commodity, however, DT wishes to pillage those goods first! Its generally a good idea if you are a pale geek to have some sunscreen at the top of your list. Other honorable mentions are: Blister preventions, Band&#8211;aids, Gel shoe inserts, Personal cooling devices, Pain relievers and antacids, Bottle openers, Personal voice recorders, water filters, and last but not least an Alibi.</item>
        <item>This FAQ didn\'t answer my questions, or was unclear, how can I get further information? </item>
        <item>There is a forum discussion thread in which you can ask follow up questions. https://forum.defcon.org/showthread.php?t=6845 </item>
