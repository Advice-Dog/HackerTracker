        <b>When and where is DEF CON 21?</b>\n\n

        DEF CON is generally in the last week of July or first week of August in Las Vegas. DEF CON 21 will be held August 1-4, 2013 at the Rio Hotel &amp; Casino in Las Vegas. Many people arrive a day early, and many stay a day later. Again this year we will have some things running on Thursday.  \n\n

        Rio Hotel and Casino: \n
        3700 W Flamingo Rd\n
        Las Vegas, Nevada 89103\n
        866-746-7671\n\n

        <b>Is DEF CON 21 canceled? </b>   \n\n

        No.\n\n

        <b>How much is admission?</b> \n\n

        $180.00 USD, Cash for all four days. Everyone pays the same: The government, the media, the ‘well known hackers’, the unknown script kiddies. The only discount is for Goons and speakers, who get to work without paying for the privilege. We only accept cash - no checks, no money orders, no travelers checks. We don\'t want to be a target of any State or Federal fishing expeditions.   \n\n

        <b>Can I pre-register for DEF CON? </b>   \n\n

        No.    \n\n

        <b>How many people will be there?</b>  \n\n

        Last year we had an estimated 13,000 people come out our 20th anniversary hacker extravaganza! We may even continue to grow this year!   \n\n

        <b>How much do rooms at the Rio cost, and how do I reserve a room?</b>  \n\n

        The DEF CON 21 group room registration at the Rio is now live! The room rates are $104 Sunday thru Thursday and $118 per night on Friday and Saturday. You may either follow this link: http://www.totalrewards.com/hotel-reservations?propCode=RLV&amp;groupCode=SRDEF13 Or call the Rio toll free at 1-888-746-6955 and refer to group code: SRDEF13  \n\n

        <b>I can\'t afford that.</b>\n\n

        Try the Ride and Room sharing threads on the Forums. You may also want to visit your Local DEF CON Groups meeting and see who you might want to bunk up with. It\'s important to mention you should use good judgment when sharing a room and consider who is sleeping next to you and who has access to your belongings. That said, there are a lot of great people looking to save a buck or pinch a penny, good luck. \n\n

        <b>How much is internet access in the rooms of the Rio?</b> \n\n

        $13.95 for 24 hours. Internet access is available for free in the convention area. \n\n

        <b>Is there a free network at DEF CON? </b>\n\n

        Why yes, DEF CON 21 is FULLY network-enabled. Now that we\'ve perfected the art of a stable hacker con network, we\'re ascending to a higher level - we\'re providing you a network that you feel SAFE in using! Since DEF CON 18 we\'re WPA2 encrypted over-the-air, with a direct trunk out to the Internet. No peer-to-peer, no sniffing, just straight to the net (and internal servers). We\'ll provide login credentials at Registration. We know the 3G airwaves will be saturated so we\'re putting our own cred on the line to give you a net that even we would put our own mobile phones on. \n\n

        If you\'re feeling frisky, we\'ll still have the traditional \"open\" network for you - bring your laptop (we\'d recommend a clean OS, fully patched&#8212;you know the procedure) because we don\'t police what happens on that net. Share &amp;enjoy!  \n\n

        <b>Will the Rio allow free parking? </b>    \n\n

        Yes. You will be able to park for free regardless if you have a room at the Rio.       \n\n

        <b>What about the smoking policy?</b>  \n\n

        Due to the Clean Air Act in Las Vegas, the Vendor Area, Speaking rooms, and Hallways will be completely non-smoking in order to comply with the law. The Hotel will have designated smoking areas clearly posted. There is a discussion about it on the DEF CON Forums here: https://forum.defcon.org/showthread.php?t=8200     \n\n
        Any news and info will likely be posted there.

        <b>What is the age limit?</b>    \n\n

        People have brought children to DEF CON - it is not recommended to do this unless you are going to constantly supervise them. It is generally an ‘adult’ atmosphere (language, booze, et cetera). If you\'ve never been to DEF CON, you may want to refrain from bringing your children (unless they are demanding that you bring them). While there are no age limits, we have consistently cooperated with parents and/or private investigators who are looking for children that ‘ran away from home’ to go to DEF CON. You must be 18 years of age or older to reserve a hotel room and to check-in. A valid ID is required upon check-in. DEF CON 21 will have enforcement of the 21 or older rule in certain "private" parties with possible bouncers at the doors checking IDs. This is generally the rule in all areas where alcohol is being served. However, DEF CON does not take responsibility for anything potentially indecent or offensive your minor may witness or participate in. The underage attendee is the responsibility of his or her guardian or themselves. The presentations are open to all ages. Observation of contests as they take place on the contest floor is open to all ages. Competition in some contests may have age restrictions due to laws. There is plenty fun to be had without booze and gambling! There is a discussion regarding fun for those under 21 on the forums. https://forum.defcon.org/showthread.php?t=8232 \n\n

        <b>I want to speak, how do I give a talk?</b>   \n\n

        GREAT! We are looking for and give preference to: unique research, new tool releases, Ø-day attacks (with responsible disclosure), highly technical material, social commentaries, and ground breaking material of any kind. Want to screen a new hacking documentary or release research? Consider DEF CON. To submit a speech, read the Announcement and complete the DEF CON 21 Call for Papers Form: https://www.defcon.org/html/defcon-21/dc-21-cfp-form.html CFP forms and questions should get mailed to: talks/at/defcon.org\n\n

        <b>How can I help or participate?</b>  \n\n

        DEF CON is not a spectator sport! Before the con, during, and after there are chances for you to get involved. Below is a list of this years contests and events. This list may not be complete so check the forums to see what people are up to. Go to the forums for more info on Contests and Events: https://forum.defcon.org/forumdisplay.php?f=616 \n\n

        <b>How do I become a Vendor?</b>         \n\n

        The Vendor area application and FAQ can be found at https://defcon.hackingyour.net. Stay tuned for the announcement! If you want a space in our vendor area, you need to apply. Because of limited space and our attempt to have a diversity of vendors, you may not be able to get a booth. It is wise to think of staffing issues - if you are one person do you want to spend your entire time behind a vendors booth?\n\n

        <b>I\'m press, how do I sign up, why can\'t I get in for free (\'m just doing my job)? </b>  \n\n

        Please email press[at]defcon[dot]org if you wish press credentials. Lots of people come to DEF CON and are doing their job; security professionals, federal agents, and the press. It wouldn\'t be fair to DEF CON attendees if we exempted one group from paying. If you are a major network and plan on doing a two minute piece showing all the people with blue hair, you probably shouldn\'t bother applying for a press pass - you won\'t get one. If you are a security writer or from a real publication please submit, and someone will respond with an answer.\n\n

        <b>What should I bring to DEF CON? </b>       \n\n

        It depends on what you\'re going to do at DEF CON. This is discussed in quite some depth on the unofficial DC FAQ, as well as a thread in the DC Forums. You may want to bring fancy (or outrageously silly) clothes for the Black and White Balls, annual Friday and Saturday night events where everyone shows off nifty attire. SWAG is Always recommended, people LOVE to trade! You never know when or where a t-shirt with your .org will come in handy. Government SWAG is a hot commodity, however, DT wishes to pillage those goods first! Its generally a good idea if you are a pale geek to have some sunscreen at the top of your list. Other honorable mentions are: Blister preventions, Band-aids, Gel shoe inserts, Personal cooling devices, Pain relievers and antacids, Bottle openers, Personal voice recorders, water filters, and last but not least an Alibi.\n\n

        <b>This FAQ didn\'t answer my questions, or was unclear, how can I get further information? </b>           \n\n

        There is a forum discussion thread in which you can ask follow up questions. https://forum.defcon.org/showthread.php?t=6845

    <string name="about">Hi :) I\'m Whitney, aka short stack.\n\nI started making this app about a year ago, when I would miss my first DEF CON in 4 years.\n\nI wanted to give something back to a community who has taught me so much, and allowed me to meet such great people. I worked on it in my "spare time", which is few and far between these days, with 10 month old, and a career.
        \n\nSo if you find any errors/typos/etc, or have any suggestions, shoot me a message. I can be found on the interwebs at http://twitter.com/</string>
