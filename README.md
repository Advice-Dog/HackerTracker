DEF CON 23 :) hooray!

in order to make the app *official* this year, i needed to pull the schedule directly from the DEF CON information booth. so unlike previous years, i am no longer manually adding parties or contests or events ad hoc--it is all coming from the organizers.

the schedule will be complete the wednesday before the conference, and the option to sync with their database for ongoing updates will be unlocked.
